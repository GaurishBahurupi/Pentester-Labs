# Solving the Recon 02 Lab: Retrieving the security.txt from hackycorp.com

**Understanding the Objective**

In this challenge, the goal was to retrieve the `security.txt` file from the main website for hackycorp.com. `security.txt` is a standard that allows websites to define security policies, including contact information for security researchers. The objective was to demonstrate the ability to locate and access this file on the target website.

**Approach**

To approach this challenge, I conducted research to understand the standard location and format of the `security.txt` file. Upon investigating, I found that `security.txt` files can typically be served under the `/security.txt` or `/.well-known/security.txt` directories of a website. Armed with this knowledge, I proceeded to locate the file on hackycorp.com.

**Execution**

Using a web browser or a command-line tool such as `curl` or `wget`, I attempted to access the `security.txt` file on hackycorp.com by navigating to both the `/security.txt` and `/.well-known/security.txt` paths. After entering the URLs `hackycorp.com/security.txt` and `hackycorp.com/.well-known/security.txt`, I successfully retrieved the `security.txt` file.

**Outcome**

By accessing the `security.txt` file on hackycorp.com, I was able to retrieve the flag hidden within the file's content. This confirmed the successful completion of the Recon 02 Lab challenge.

**Conclusion**

The Recon 02 Lab provided an opportunity to practice reconnaissance techniques and familiarize myself with the `security.txt` standard. By leveraging knowledge of standard file locations and conducting targeted searches, I successfully retrieved the `security.txt` file from hackycorp.com and achieved the challenge objective.
