| Outcome   | Trigger a 404/"Not Found" error, find the flag in the error message   |

### Detailed Solution

**Understanding the Objective**

The goal of this challenge was to demonstrate the ability to identify a specific condition on the target website, which in this case was generating a 404 error. By doing so, we could potentially reveal hidden directories or sensitive information that might not be accessible through standard navigation.

**Approach**

To approach this challenge, I started by analyzing the structure of the hackycorp.com website. By exploring the site's directory structure and attempting to access directories that might not exist, I aimed to trigger a 404 error.

**Execution**

I began by appending a random string of characters as a directory at the end of the hackycorp.com URL. For example, I accessed `hackycorp.com/randomdirectory1234`, anticipating that this directory would not exist and thus trigger a 404 error.

**Outcome**

As expected, navigating to the non-existent directory `hackycorp.com/randomdirectory` resulted in a 404/"Not Found" error. Upon inspecting the error page, I discovered the flag hidden within the error message, indicating successful completion of the challenge.

**Conclusion**

The Recon 01 Lab provided an excellent opportunity to practice reconnaissance techniques and demonstrate the importance of thorough website analysis in penetration testing. By effectively generating a 404 error on the target website, I successfully uncovered hidden information and achieved the objective of the challenge.
