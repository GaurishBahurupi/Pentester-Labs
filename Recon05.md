### Detailed Solution

**Understanding the Objective**

In the Recon 05 Lab, the goal was to find a directory on hackycorp.com that is not directly accessible. This required utilizing directory brute-forcing techniques to discover hidden directories that may not be easily accessible through standard navigation.

**Approach**

To approach this challenge, I employed the use of FFUF, a powerful directory and file brute-forcing tool. FFUF allows for the systematic enumeration of directories by trying various permutations and combinations. This approach is efficient for discovering hidden directories that may not be directly accessible.

**Execution**

Using FFUF, I initiated a directory brute force attack on hackycorp.com, specifying common directory names and extensions. Within a few minutes of running FFUF, I discovered a directory named 'startpage' that was not directly accessible through standard navigation.

**Outcome**

Upon accessing the 'startpage' directory, I found the flag hidden within its contents. This confirmed the successful completion of the Recon 05 Lab challenge.

**Conclusion**

The Recon 05 Lab provided an opportunity to demonstrate the effectiveness of directory brute-forcing techniques in uncovering hidden directories on a target website. By leveraging tools like FFUF, I successfully discovered the 'startpage' directory containing the flag, showcasing the importance of thorough reconnaissance in penetration testing and cybersecurity assessments.
