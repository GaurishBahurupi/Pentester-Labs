### Detailed Solution

**Approach**

To approach this challenge, I started by analyzing the source code of the hackycorp.com website. By inspecting the HTML source code, I aimed to identify any references to directories or files that might not be directly accessible through navigation.

**Execution**

Upon viewing the page source, I noticed a reference to a `logo.png` file located in an `images` directory. Intrigued by this discovery, I attempted to access the `images` directory directly by appending `/images` to the website URL. This led me to a directory listing page, revealing the contents of the `images` directory, including a file named `key.txt`.

**Outcome**

By accessing the `images` directory with directory listing enabled, I was able to locate the `key.txt` file containing the flag. This confirmed the successful completion of the Recon 03 Lab challenge.

**Conclusion**

The Recon 03 Lab demonstrated the importance of thorough reconnaissance in identifying hidden directories and files on a target website. By carefully analyzing the website's source code and leveraging directory listing, I successfully uncovered the `key.txt` file and achieved the challenge objective.
