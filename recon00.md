# Solving the Recon 00 Lab: Retrieving the robots.txt from hackycorp.com

**Understanding the Objective**

In the Recon 00 Lab of Pentester Lab's CTF, the goal was to retrieve the robots.txt file from the main website for hackycorp.com. The robots.txt file is commonly used to provide instructions to web crawlers and can sometimes reveal interesting directories or files that are disallowed from indexing.

**Approach**

To accomplish this challenge, I utilized a simple reconnaissance technique by navigating to the `/robots.txt` directory on the hackycorp.com website. The robots.txt file typically resides in the root directory of a website and can be accessed directly through the browser.

**Execution**

I visited the URL `hackycorp.com/robots.txt` in my web browser, anticipating that this would allow me to retrieve the contents of the robots.txt file. Upon accessing the robots.txt directory, I found that it contained disallowed directories and files, including the flag, which was hidden within the file.

**Outcome**

By navigating to the robots.txt directory, I successfully retrieved the contents of the robots.txt file and found the flag hidden within. This completion of the challenge demonstrated the importance of reconnaissance in uncovering potentially sensitive information and vulnerabilities on target websites.

**Conclusion**

The Recon 00 Lab provided a straightforward yet essential exercise in reconnaissance techniques. By retrieving the robots.txt file from the target website, I was able to discover valuable information about disallowed directories and files, including the flag required to complete the challenge.

This experience underscores the significance of thorough reconnaissance in penetration testing and highlights the utility of leveraging publicly accessible resources such as the robots.txt file to gather intelligence about target websites.
